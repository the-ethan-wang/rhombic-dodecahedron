## 10/19/2025 - I did some maths and made a model in sketchup  

I don't want it to be too small but it's also my first print for a very long time so im making it 15 mm edges for my first design.

anyways i did maths and research

\operatorname{triangle}\left(\left(-1,\ 0,\ 0\right),\ \left(-2,\ 0,\ 0\right),\ \left(-1,\ -1,\ 1\right)\right)

theta = arctan(1/sqrt(2)) = arcsin(1/sqrt(3) = 35.2643897 degrees or 0.615479709 radians
the other thing for the angles of each face is arccos(1/3) so around 70.5287794 degrees and 109.4712206 degrees
diagonals of faces: 2*sqrt(2) and 2
face sides are all sqrt(3)
